## Deploy a simple Node.js application onto the Application Container Cloud using the GUI##

Start by downloading the [zip file](bin/node-server.zip) containing the Node.js artifacts of the application.  This is a very elementary Message Board application, allowing you to create topics and post entries on these topics.

Open the file to understand the content of this package : 
+ manifest.json : This file is specific to Application Container Cloud, and specifies how to start your application and the Node.js runtime version to use. Optionally, you can include notes and a release indication. 
+ server.js : the Node.js script running on the server
+ index2.htlm : a html5 script containing client-side javascript calling the server-side application

If you are interested in understanding this application, a [detailed tutorial to construct this application step by step](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/apaas/node-basicRest/nodecloud-REST.html#section2) is available.

Now launch your Oracle Cloud Dashboard:
+ Go to cloud.oracle.com and use your cloud credentials
+ Click on the "Hamburger" symbol besides the Application Container and select "Open Service Console"
